  summary: Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python.

  description: |
    Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine.
    It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract,
    as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica
    imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others.
    Additionally, if used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the
    recognized text instead of writing it to a file
